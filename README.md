# ISS Insight üõ∞Ô∏è
Real-Time International Space Station (ISS) Tracker with Python

A Python script that fetches TLE data of the ISS (ZARYA) satellite, calculates its position, predicts its orbit and visualizes its trajectory on an interactive map. Thanks to [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/) We can access to the TLE data of satellites, including International Space Station.
